## Introduction

Text data often contains valuable insights into market sentiment, making it a powerful tool for predicting price movements in commodities. This project combines sentiment analysis and advanced feature engineering using LLMs to uncover patterns influencing commodities prices.

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Textual data (e.g., news articles or reports related to commodities).
- Price movement labels for various commodities.

Features were extracted using NLP techniques like bag-of-words, TF-IDF, embeddings, and advanced contextual representations from LLMs.

## Methods

### Text Preprocessing
- Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and embeddings from large language models like BERT.

### Feature Engineering with LLMs
- Generated contextual embeddings to capture semantic meaning.
- Derived sentiment scores and key insights from LLM outputs.

### Modeling
- Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).
